# Pardus Copyleft License (PCL) — Draft

**Version:** 1.0 (Draft)

**Preamble**
This license is a copyleft license intended to preserve users' freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute the Licensed Work and Derivative Works, while making clear the scope of responsibilities and warranties. The Pardus Organization ("Pardus") is granted the exclusive right to provide authoritative explanations of the terms and conditions of this license; such explanations are interpretive only and do not by themselves amend the license text.

## 1. Definitions

* **Licensed Work**: The original work(s) distributed under this License.
* **You**: The individual or legal entity exercising rights under this License.
* **Derivative Work**: Any work that is based on (or derived from) the Licensed Work, whether modified, extended, translated, or otherwise adapted.
* **Distribution**: Conveying the Licensed Work or a Derivative Work to another party by any means.

## 2. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Pardus hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual license to:

1. Reproduce and use the Licensed Work.
2. Prepare, reproduce, use, and distribute Derivative Works.
3. Sublicense any of the foregoing rights, provided that any such sublicenses comply with Section 3 below.

These rights are granted on the condition that any Distributed Derivative Work is licensed to recipients under the same terms as this License (the "Copyleft Requirement").

---

## 3. Copyleft Requirement

If You distribute the Licensed Work or any Derivative Work, You must ensure that:

1. The distributed work remains under the Pardus Copyleft License (PCL) version 1.0 or a later version explicitly published by Pardus.
2. A copy of this License (or a link to the official text published by Pardus) is included with the distributed work.
3. Clear attribution is given to the original authors of the Licensed Work, stating that the work is distributed under the PCL.

---

## 4. Attribution and Source Availability

When distributing source or binaries, You must:

1. Keep intact any existing copyright notices and include a prominent statement that the work is licensed under the Pardus Copyleft License.
2. Make the source code of any Derivative Work available under the same terms when distributing binaries.

---

## 5. Patent Rights

Subject to any express statement to the contrary by Pardus, Pardus grants no patent license to You under this License. If You knowingly grant patent licenses to others for patents that would necessarily be infringed by Your Derivative Work, You must license those patents under terms consistent with the Copyleft Requirement for recipients of the Derivative Work.

---

## 6. Pardus's Interpretive Authority

Pardus shall have the exclusive, authoritative right to issue official explanations, clarifications, and interpretations of the terms of this License ("Official Interpretations"). Official Interpretations shall be considered authoritative for the purposes of understanding obligations under this License.

**Limitations on Interpretive Authority:**

* Official Interpretations are interpretive only and do not by themselves modify or amend the written license text. To change the license terms, Pardus must publish a new version of the PCL (e.g., "PCL 1.1").
* Official Interpretations are binding only to the extent that parties rely on them in good faith; they do not retroactively alter rights previously granted under an earlier, unambiguous written license.

## 7. No Maintenance Obligation

Pardus and any contributor are under no obligation to provide maintenance, support, updates, enhancements, or fixes for the Licensed Work or any Derivative Work. Any offers to provide such support are entirely voluntary and outside the scope of this License.

IN NO EVENT WILL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR CONTRIBUTORS (INCLUDING PARDUS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

---

## 10. Termination

Your rights under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms and do not cure such breach within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of it. Upon termination, You must cease all distribution of the Licensed Work and Derivative Works.

---

## 11. Future Versions
